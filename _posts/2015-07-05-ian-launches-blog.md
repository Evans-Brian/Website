OK this has been a lot of work... but I think I've finally got a decent website!

## Subtitle

I can do bullet points

- Good for making points
- Clear and concise
- Hopefully this is formatted nicely

What about if I need to quote someone:

> Well I did used to talk a lot of nonsense when I was younger...

Or insert a block of code:

~~~
a = 5
print(a)
~~~

### Sub sub title

Do equations work though?
Inline
$$ A = \int_{x=0}^T f(x) dx $$
and also distinguished
\[\mathbb{E} \left[ \mathcal{X} | \mathcal{F}_t \right] \]

If so, then it looks like this is pretty good.
