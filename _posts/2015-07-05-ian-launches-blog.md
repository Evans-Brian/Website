OK this has been a lot of work... but I think I've finally got a decent website!

## Subtitle

I can do bullet points

- Good for making points
- Clear and concise
- Hopefully this is formatted nicely

What about if I need to quote someone:

> Well I did used to talk a lot of nonsense when I was younger...

Or insert a block of code:

~~~
a = 5
print(a)
~~~

This is **bold**, this is *italics*.

## Using Mathjax

I want to see if equations work properly...

Inline like this,
$$ I_1 = \int_{x=0}^1 f(x) dx$$
but also central display

$$\mathbb{E} \left[ \mathcal{X} | \mathcal{F}_t \right]
  = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \gamma^i = \frac{1}{1 - \gamma}$$

If so, then it looks like this is pretty good.
